# Dissertation Project
This is the project I created for my final year dissertation at NTU. Its a self hosted cloud storage application, designed to allow a user with very little knowledge to install and setup in one or two clicks (more if they want it to be useable outside of their local network). This project ran alongside a research paper about the decline and pros and cons of owning versus renting data.
